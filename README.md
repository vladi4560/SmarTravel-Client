# SmarTravel-Client
The purpose of the system is to provide the easiest-to-use free travel for planning every kind of
trip, including road trips-for the user, based on his favorite places. No more switching between
different apps, tabs, and tools to keep track of your travel plans. Every time you add a place to
visit, it is immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up
different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in
the " SmarTravel‚Äù trip planner app! Plus, if you are visiting points in order, lines will connect the
different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). Benefits: save time
and money and do not miss a favorite place.
